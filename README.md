## üìù Project Overview

This web application allows users‚Äîregardless of technical background‚Äîto:
- Input medical parameters relevant to breast cancer.
- Receive instant and reliable malignancy predictions.
- Understand prediction logic through intuitive visualizations.

The app is intended as a proof of concept for accessible, explainable AI in healthcare.
